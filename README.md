This graphic shows how the duration of rides is split amongst genders, it can be seen from the peaks of the graph that females ride for a slightly shorter time than males.

## Summary

We can observe that NYC Citi Bike had a total of 2,344,224 rides. Men made up about 65 percent of known clients, while women made up 25 percent. Peak riding times were found to be between 7am-9am and from 5pm-7pm during the weekdays. One visualization I would propose would be to include the top locations in the peak times to see where demand can be met or moved around to effectively use resources. Another visualization would be to see if there is a significant difference gender and location.
